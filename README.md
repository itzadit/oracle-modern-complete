# oracle-modern-complete

A modern Python version of the Grover’s Algorithm “Oracle” project. It simulates a quantum search that finds letters from a random array, sometimes showing “not found” results. Built with Qiskit, it’s educational, realistic, and easy to run—perfect for understanding how quantum search works.
